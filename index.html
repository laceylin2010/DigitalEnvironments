      <h2>Systems Design</h2>
      <p>System design is the process of designing the elements of a system such as the architecture, modules, and components, the different interfaces of those components, and the data that goes through that system.</p>
      <h3>Elements of a System:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Architecture</strong> – This is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behaviour, and views of a system. We can use flowcharts to represent and illustrate the architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Modules</strong> – These are components that handle one specific task in a system. A combination of the modules makes up the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Components</strong> – This provides a particular function or group of related functions. They are made up of modules.</li>
        <li><strong>Interfaces</strong> – This is the shared boundary across which the components of the system exchange information and relate.</li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> – This is the management of the information and data flow.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Info Architecture</h2>
    <p>Information Architecture (IA) is the practice of structuring, organizing, and presenting information in a way that makes it easy for users to find and navigate. It plays a key role in User Experience (UX) design, ensuring that digital products like websites, apps, and software are user-friendly and intuitive. By focusing on how content is arranged and accessed, IA helps users quickly locate the information they need — improving overall usability and satisfaction.</p>
  
    <p>There are numerous amounts of data organizing structures that designers can use in Info Architecture. These types of structures enhance user experience and provide users with intuitive and user-friendly interfaces:</p>
  
        <ul>
    <li><strong>Hierarchical Structure</strong>: This is one of the most common and straightforward ways to organize information.</li>
    <li><strong>Sequential Structure</strong>: This organizes information in a linear or chronological order.</li>
    <li><strong>Matrix Structure</strong>: This allows information to be organized based on multiple criteria or dimensions, forming a grid-like arrangement.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Structure</strong>: Connects different pieces of information like nodes in a web, where each node can link to multiple others.</li>
    <li><strong>Database or Faceted Structure</strong>: This allows users to refine their search results.</li>
    <li><strong>Alphabetical or A–Z Structure</strong>: This arranges information from A-Z to make it easier for users to find specific items when they know the name or title.</li>
    <li><strong>Search-based Structure</strong>: Allows users to find information through a search bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Structure</strong>: Organizes information in a way that mirrors physical environments or virtual spaces.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Bias and Misinformation</h2>
      <p>Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information that is shared, often without the intention to deceive. Unlike disinformation, which is deliberately false and shared with the purpose of manipulation, misinformation is typically spread by people who believe the information to be true. This distinction is essential because misinformation, though unintentional, can still have harmful consequences. Alot of times misinformation happens subconsiously as we read titles of articles, pass information from word of mouth, or research information that is actually false.</p>

      <p>Due to the speed of the internet and technology advancing, misinformation is spread so much quicker now than it was 20 years from now. It is now more important than ever too recognize when misinformation and bias is happening on the web.</p>

      <p>Recognizing misinformation can be very critical when determining a reliable source. A couple key points to consider are verifying the source, examining the author, analyzing the content for red flags, cross-referencing with other sources, and watching for manipulated media.</p>

      <h2>UX and Visual Design</h2>
      <h3>User Experience (UX)</h3>
         <p>User experience is how a user interacts with a product. This can be a physical product or digital. User experience is whether or not a user is able to innteract smoothly with tthe product. User experience is the overall experience a user has. </p>
        <p>User experience, often shortened to UX, refers to the overall experience a customer or user has when interacting with a product, system or service. UX takes all the user’s feelings about the product or service, including ease of use, accessibility, visual design, functions of the user interface, and the emotional impact of using the product to then make an assessment.</p>

        <p>The benefits of user experience is:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased customer satisfaction</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Improved customer retention</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Higher conversion rates</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Reduced support costs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Strong brand repuation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Competitive edge</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>WWhen thinking about design, it is important to be able to empathize with users. Find out what problems users may have and be open to multiple solutions. </p>
        <p>define what the users want and need and how the problem effects their ability to complete a task</p>
        <p>Brainstorm ideas and solutions that make sense based on test findings </p>
        <p>Create many designs and make prototypes to trial annd error</p>
        <p>Test the prototypes to find best solutions</p>

        <h3>Visual Design (UX)</h3>
        <p>Visual design can be as simple as the way something looks and its aesthetic to strategetically designed images to encourage users to buy products. It's goal is to attract users through images, color, layour, and typography. Visual designs that are effective can communicate messages clearly and help improve a users experience. There are several different types of visual designs. It ranges from websites, apps, home products, anything to help guide a user through their product. </p>
        <p>There are several elements to visual design. The visual designn elements are lines, shapes, negative space/whitespace, volume, value, color, and texture. It is important to create good visual design that is consitent, organized, and distinctive. A visual designer needs to be able to meet users expectations to keep users loyal and impress them with innovative designs. Otherwise, users can quickly move to other companies and websites.   /p>
